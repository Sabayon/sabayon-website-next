**After more than a year of silence, we are back**

We know, you were already wondering, whether this project is still alive,
but rest assured that the development was steadily ongoing.

A lot has changed, so we are excited to share the news with you! Let's go!

<abbr title="Too long; didn't read">TL;DR</abbr>:
* New team
* New release strategy
* New build system
* Funding situation

## New team

In 2017 the team behind Sabayon grew.
Now we have a test team, a webmaster and motivated "old dogs".
So expect more changes to happen ;-)

The focus of the webmaster will be on the website first, then turning to the
wiki before looking on improving the forums.

If you have ideas, feel free to drop them at
ryuno-ki at sabayonlinux.org.

## New release strategy

Sabayon used to release a new version every month.
Sadly it turned out to not be sustainable given the limited number of persons
working on it.
The new strategy is to keep on releasing daily images for testing and
contributors and publish stable images for every new LTS Linux kernel.

### Available releases

We offer only 64bit releases.

You can find GNOME, KDE, Xfce and Mate images in the release section.
If you happen to find bugs, please report them(), so we can fix :-)

## New build system

The homepage listed, that several universities were hosting Sabayon's build
servers. In 2017 it was moved to Google Cloud to have a more reliable and
better specced machine.
Moreover, with the advent of
<abbr title="Sabayon Community-Repositories">SCR</abbr> the team could trim down
the core code base to something easier to guarantee to be stable without
sacrificing new software versions.

## Funding situation

Sadly, the move to Google Cloud incurred a price which can't be paid by the team
alone. We never asked you for anything, but you would do us a favour if you
could donate a few bucks every month to keep this distribution running.

With that the team wishes you a Happy New Year 2018!

Keep rocking!
