## New Build Infrastructure

Most of the changes that we did sadly aren't noticeable from a user perspective, so we want to share
our happiness about the codebase state.

We've invested time in making our internal tooling better, dramatically important for future enhancements to our rolling release model.

We are using [Mottainai](https://mottainaici.github.io/docs/) in our build infrastructure to automatize build and release
of Sabayon, allowing us to scale horizontally the load required to build ISOs, packages and more.

The impact is noticeable for us, e.g. to build all ISOs flavors it now takes less than 2 hours!

This enables us to care less about repetitive tasks and ease the development process, as we can release bugfixes and do proper QA in 
1/10 of the time before!


## Switch to Dracut as Initramfs

Yes! You heard it well! We moved away from genkernel-next for initramfs generation, and now initramfs is generated on user side.

Additional information is available [here](https://sabayon.github.io/wiki-next/articles/initramfs/).

## New Wiki

We heard you, the current wiki is (sadly) in an embarassing state - but we are working on a completely new restyle of it.
As time passed, a lot changed in the Sabayon defaults that aren't reflected anymore in the current wiki. We encourage for the moment
to snoop over the new wiki which is in the works, as we are adding new articles and documentation [here](https://sabayon.github.io/wiki-next/).


## What to expect next()?!
Our artwork needs attention, next release might feature a new look and will have more polishing.

We're looking into possible deprecation of the nvidia-drivers-340.XX series to reduce effort needed for keeping new kernels in shape. We're eager to hear your thoughts.

We're working on getting a 5.X kernel out into the repository to fully unlock Freesync for our users. Linux Gaming FTW!

LLVM and Clang 8 are in the works. Better support for OpenCL, OpenMP, AMDGPU Backends, and support for newer CUDA devices.

ARM support? Absolutely! New layered ARMv7 repositories are being developed. We expect them to be ready soon.

We are also working on unattended installer and updates to our server flavor which is more oriented for Cloud/VMs.

Various package bumps. Get Ready for a refresh! FFMPEG? Check! Ruby? Check! libvdpau? Check! and many more!


## Thanks to our Patreons

Thank you all very much for your support! Without your help this release couldn't be possible. 
We've finally had enough finance to rent machines to use in our new build infrastructure!
