The team behind Sabayon is excited to present you the latest release:
Sabayon 18.04.

Sabayon is a modern and easy to use distribution based on Gentoo,
which follows a reliable rolling release model.

Originally we planned to release it last December,
but then an update with GCC on Gentoo profiles made us rebuild almost all
packages.

Please read on or [download](/download) your flavour :-)

In general, the release is a new snapshot so that after fresh install you
have less updates, but there is more: it has been worked out, tested, improved,
fixed and discussed, all within the small but active team of voluteers that
work on this distribution, so that you can get it, install it and enjoy it!

## Changes

* Kernel 4.14
* GNOME 3.24
* KDE 5.12
* Mate 1.18

### Some picks

Sabayon has now a [Facebook profile](https://www.facebook.com/sabayon.linux)
with a speaking name next to our
[Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/36125411841).

Development is open, so if you want to have a look at what has been done in
detail, it's right there; you can find the link in the Download section below.

### What was dropped?

With this release, we are in the process of dropping support for Qt4, which
[reached its end of life in december 2015](https://wiki.qt.io/Main#Quick_Access_.28Portal.29) (!)

Due to changes in its policy, we had to take down or Vagrant image.
We still have a [Docker profile](https://hub.docker.com/r/sabayon) though.
