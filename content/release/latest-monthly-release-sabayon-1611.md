![Sabayon Press release](/img/press-header-roll_0.png)

Sabayon 16.11 is a modern and easy to use Linux distribution based on Gentoo,
following an extreme, yet reliable, rolling release model.

This is a *major* release that is the result of a hard round of testing,
and it is published to mirrors with the latest and greatest collection of
software available in the Entropy repositories.
The full changelogs for this release are available on
[our mirrors](http://dl.sabayon.org/iso/monthly/ChangeLogs/).

The list of packages included in each Sabayon flavor
is available inside ".pkglist" files on the mirrors.
Our team is always busy packaging the newest software just for you.
If you want to have a look at what's available in our repositories, just go to
our [packages website](https://packages.sabayon.org/).

All the release variants can be found in the [download section](/download).

Please read on for links to the images and torrent files on our mirrors.

# Changes

This Sabayon release is the result of team work, time and care,
to provide you with a stable, solid and bleeding edge release!

There are a lot of exciting changes in this release, here's a few:

* New Anaconda Installer version, with tons of bugfixes
* Latest kernel 4.8
* Latest KDE-Plasma version
* Renewed artwork
* New Greeter!
* Improvements and fixes to Entropy (the package manager)
* New supported ARM devices!

We've added support for Odroid X2/U2/U3/C2 ARM devices, and thanks to geaaru,
we added BananaPi to the list too.
Daily builds can be found on our mirrors, under the "testing" folder.

Sabayon developers have decided to switch to a different release schedule:

* Stable releases will be available (if there are no stoppers)
  at the end of January, May and October.
  They are still found under the "monthly/" directory in the mirrors,
  but from now you will find tagged stable releases under "stable/".
* Daily images can always be found under the "daily" folder and
  these are incremental updates
  (though we can't guarantee these will always be in a working state).

# New Website

Our old website has been around since the beginning.
But we are happy, after a long development period to switch to a more modern
and bleeding edge design touch that also works better for mobile devices.

If you want to send feedback about the website or want to contribute,
join us on IRC or drop an email to [website@sabayon.org](mailto:website@sabayon.org).

# Release information

Here will follow generic information about the available releases,
along with the current state of Sabayon.

## Available releases

As for now, we offer 64bit and ARM images.

But you are free to choose between the wonderful minimalism of GNOME,
the eyecandy of KDE or the old fart called Xfce.
If you are the kind of person who just needs Fluxbox/Openbox/whatever else,
just get the Minimal image and you won’t be hit by the “OMG candies” bloat
that is in the other images.

## Docker

We offer official docker releases. You can find them in 
[our official docker profile](https://hub.docker.com/r/sabayon).
They are updated daily with the latest and greatest stuff from
Entropy repositories.
There also is a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/sabayon/builder-amd64/)
available to build Sabayon packages as well,
without the need to have all the tools required in your existing machine
[here](http://blog.mudler.pm/2015/11/part-1-building-gentoo-and-sabayon.html)
you can find a guide on how to use the Docker builder image.

## Vagrant images

We couldn't ship just docker images of course.
You can find a barebone Sabayon image in the
[VagrantCloud (now called Atlas)](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/Sabayon/boxes/spinbase-amd64).
Deploying a Sabayon image now can be even more easier:

    vagrant init Sabayon/spinbase-amd64; vagrant up --provider virtualbox


## Sabayon Server Edition

The Server Edition is just perfect for those
who want to run this distro as a pure server.
The installer is still Anaconda (with Text install mode),
after install all the additional components required by Anaconda
are removed from the system. We now also service you with Vagrant images.

## Binary vs Source Package Manager

It’s up to you whether turn a newly Sabayon installation into
a geeky Gentoo ~arch system or just camp on the lazy side and
enjoy the power of our binary, simplified Applications Manager (a.k.a. Rigo).
With Sabayon you are really in control of your system the way you really want.
[Read the wiki page if you plan mixing the two package managers](https://wiki.sabayon.org/index.php?title=HOWTO:_Safely_mix_Entropy_and_Portage).

## Native NVIDIA and AMD GPU drivers support

All our releases natively support the latest and greatest GPU hardware
from NVIDIA and AMD through their proprietary drivers.
Whether you want to enjoy your Linux rig for gaming or video playback,
you can. For AMD hardware though,
we default to the Open Source implementation for the supported cards.
Make sure to pass “nomodeset” to the boot command line
to force the proprietary drivers to be used instead:
[head over the wiki for more details](https://wiki.sabayon.org/index.php?title=HOWTO:_Get_AMD/ATI_or_Nvidia_Video_Cards_working_in_Sabayon#AMD_-_Open_Source_to_FGLRX).

## LTSI Linux kernels offered

We are tracking the 3.10, 3.12, 3.18, 4.1 and 4.4
[Long Term Stable Linux kernels](http://ltsi.linuxfoundation.org/what-is-ltsi),
offering (almost) same-day updates to them.
If you are using Sabayon in a server environment, you surely welcome this.
However, if you’re using Sabayon on your laptop, desktop workstation,
switching between kernels or just moving to a new version
has become a no-brainer operation through Rigo:
just go to the preferences menu, select the kernel menu
(LTS and regular kernels are listed in separate menus),
pick a kernel and click “Install”.
Rigo will take care of updating external modules in a reliable and
safe way on your behalf.

## Sabayon Community Repositories (SCR) are here!

Sabayon Community Repositories (SCR) is a collection of repositories
available to Sabayon users that could be enabled/removed from the system
by using enman -- our layman equivalent.
While SCR content is not as stable as main repos
(and we put a lot of warnings in the website for this reason) it is now easier
and faster than ever before to get bleeding edge packages
not available in the official repositories.

Users can search packages in the
[SCR website](https://sabayon.github.io/community-website/),
including step-by-step instructions for enabling the necessary repositories and
installing.

More information on how to use SCR is available in the
[wiki page](https://wiki.sabayon.org/index.php?title=En:Sabayon_Community_Repositories)
(under construction).
Meanwhile we are currently working on the project documentation:
[Guidelines](https://github.com/Sabayon/scr-docs/blob/master/scr-guidelines.md)
and [Bylaws](https://github.com/Sabayon/scr-docs/blob/master/scr-bylaws.md)
can be found on the
[scr-docs Github repository](https://github.com/Sabayon/scr-docs).
More information is also available
[here](http://blog.mudler.pm/2016/04/whut-sabayon-community-repositories-is.html)

Here are some packages already available in the SCR community repository
(just to name a few):

* app-editors/sublime-text
* app-emulation/genymotion
* app-emulation/shashlik-bin
* app-misc/neofetch
* app-text/cherrytree
* net-im/telegram-bin
* x11-misc/mugshot
* x11-terms/altyo
* games-arcade/fretsonfire
* media-sound/guitarix2
* dev-embedded/arduino
* app-emulation/RemoteBox
* app-crypt/veracrypt
* ... and many others! 

If you care about security (you should), you will welcome the addition of
[VeraCrypt](https://veracrypt.codeplex.com/).
Using this program, you can encrypt container on your hard drive.
VeraCrypt succeedes TrueCrypt and was
[recently audited](http://blog.quarkslab.com/security-assessment-of-veracrypt-fixes-and-evolutions-from-truecrypt.html).
If you want to encrypt your entire disk, Anaconda supports that out-of-the-box.

### SCR: Package requests

If you want a package to be added in the SCR repositories,
feel free to open a bug request
[in the specific section of our Bugzilla](https://bugs.sabayon.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Community%20Repositories):
be sure to specify if the ebuild is available in layman
if you want it to get done faster.
