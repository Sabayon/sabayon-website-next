The team behind Sabayon is excited to present you the latest of its releases:
Sabayon "Thin Lizzy" 18.03.

Sabayon is a modern and easy to use distribution based on Gentoo,
which follows a reliable rolling release model.

Originally we planned to release it last December,
but than an update with GCC on Gentoo profiles made us compile all packages
again.
In January, Spectre and Meltdown happened, so we wanted to have something
not only stable, but as secure as we could have it.

Please read on or [download](/download) your flavour :-)

## Changes

* Kernel 4.14
* GNOME 3.24
* KDE 5.12
* Xfce 4.13
* Mate 1.18

### What's new?

Sabayon has now a [Facebook profile](https://www.facebook.com/sabayon.linux)
with a speaking name next to our
[Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/36125411841).

Switching from nvidia to nouveau drivers.

The display manager SDDM now uses Breeze as default theme instead of ours.
If you are interesting in creating a theme,
[get in touch with us](/chat/) :-)

### What was dropped?

With this release, we are dropping support for Qt4, which
[reached its end of life in december 2015](https://wiki.qt.io/Main#Quick_Access_.28Portal.29) (!)

Whenever a Linux kernel reaches its end-of-life, we will drop it from entropy,
too. After all, you're here to enjoy the latest and greatest, aren't you? ;-)

Sadly, we stopped updating the updates for ARM devices (Raspberry Pi, Odroid
and BananaPi) due to a lack of time for maintenance.

Due to changes in its policy, we had to take down or Vagrant image.
We still have a [Docker profile](https://hub.docker.com/r/sabayon) though.
