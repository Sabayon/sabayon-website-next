Sabayon 18.03 is the latest stable release.
It is a distribution based on Gentoo, but follows a reliable rolling release model.

It took us over a year to assemble a collection of software, which we considered stable enough to publish it.
Originally we planned to release it last December,
but than an update with GCC on Gentoo profiles made us compile the whole tree again.
In January, Spectre and Meltdown happened, so we wanted to have something
not only stable, but as secure as we could have it.
