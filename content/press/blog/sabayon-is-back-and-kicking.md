## We're still here!

We're sure some of you are wondering when the next release will happen,
or if we're even still alive.

Well, rest assured, we're here and doing all kinds of work on Sabayon to make
the best release possible for you!

Here's a <abbr title="Too long; didn't read">TL;DR</abbr>:

* moving ecosystem
* Meltdown and Spectre
* new team
* new release strategy
* new build infrastructure
* funding

## Moving ecosystem

There's a lot going on in the world of Linux.
2017 was a huge year for Linux dev!

Graphics drivers were exploding in size and features, several kernel releases,
wine hit 3.0rc, new hardware and drivers (some amazing, some disappointing),
compilers changed, KDE and Gnome grew by leaps and bounds.

We switched to FFmpeg upon user requests for software compatibility,
bumped X.org with AMDGPU, took on the bleeding edge
without falling into the chaos of going unstable,
and we've even done some internal restructuring to lower our cost.

## Meltdown and Spectre

Now we're looking to patch Meltdown and Spectre bugs where we can.

After all that is said and done we are now looking to sync up
with the rest of the Linux community.
Gentoo has moved on and made several underlying changes
and we plan to follow suit.

This is mostly stuff on the underlying portion of Sabayon,
but results in a lot of rebuilt packages.
This can be a rather painful experience,
but we're committed to getting it done and passing on the finished
and polished product to our end users.

Everything is a moving target.
Even so, we want to find the best place to make a snapshot to show you,
our users, that we have you covered!

## New team

In 2017 the team behind Sabayon grew.
Now we have a test team, a webmaster and motivated "old dogs".

So expect more changes to happen ;-)

* optiz0r - <abbr title="Sabayon Community Repositories">SCR</abbr> maintainer
* darksurf - Testing team
* Ryuno-Ki - Webmaster
* Enlik - Overlay and binary package maintainer

The focus of the webmaster will be on the website first, then turning to the
wiki before looking on improving the forums. Any help is very welcome!

Interested in joining the Sabayon team? Everybody is welcome!

If you have ideas,
[feel free to share them with us](https://bugs.sabayon.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Hosted%20Services) :-)

## New release strategy

Sadly it turned out that our
[current release cycle](/press/release/latest-monthly-release-sabayon-1611/#changes)
were not sustainable given the limited number of people available.

The new official strategy is to follow
the Ubuntu cycle of April and November of every year.

Stable releases will be paired with LTS kernels (though as always,
newer kernels will be available for those who want them).
Monthly and daily built ISOs will still be offered, but are not guaranteed to
be thoroughly tested.

## New build infrastructure

In 2017 the Sabayon build infrastructure was moved
to more powerful and reliable servers.
This also allows more flexibility for testing significant upcoming changes
in Gentoo without affecting the daily running of Sabayon operations.

## Funding situation

We provide Sabayon to you free of charge,
but sadly the infrastructure we need to build it does cost us money.
We've recently restructured to cut costs and continue the project.
Any [donations](/participate/donate/) would be greatly appreciated.

We accept the following cryptocurrencies:

* <abbr title="Bitcoin">BTC</abbr>
* <abbr title="Bitcoin Cash">BCH</abbr>
* <abbr title="Ethereum">ETH</abbr>
* <abbr title="LiteCoin">LTC</abbr>
* <abbr title="Monero">XMR</abbr>
* <abbr title="Neo">NEO</abbr>

With that the team wishes you a New Year 2018!

Keep rocking!
