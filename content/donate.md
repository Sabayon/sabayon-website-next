The Sabayon foundation is always looking for funds. Please read below for a list of goals we are pursuing:

This is what we need to cover our daily duties:

* **New build servers:** we are in extreme need of upgrading our 4 years old main build server, please contribute!
* **Keep our infrastructure online:** our servers and mirroring infrastructure require some little cash to keep going
* **Keep our servers updated:** this year we are planning a complete build server upgrade, to make possible to push updates and fixes even faster
* **Non-profit foundation funding:** make the project team able to take part in public events, like FOSDEM (travel expenses, DVD making to give awayetc)
* **Development funding:** help us buying new hardware and feel happy geeks

**We would like to thank everybody who has donated in the past 2014. We all hope to see you back supporting us in this 2015.**
