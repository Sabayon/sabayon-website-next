Sabayon blog (Hugo-powered)
=================

Getting Started
---------------

To get started, you should simply fork or clone this repository! That's definitely an important first step.

[Install Hugo](http://gohugo.io/overview/installing) in a way that best suits your environment and comfort level.

In a command prompt or terminal, navigate to the path that contains your `config.toml` file and run `hugo`. That's it!
You should now have a `public` directory with a complete blog! Open `public/index.html` in your browser and bask.

If that wasn't amazing enough, from the same terminal, run `hugo server -w`. This will watch your directories for changes
and rebuild the site immediately, *and* it will make these changes available at http://localhost:1313/ so you can view
your finished site in your browser. Go on, try it. This is one of the best ways to preview your site while working on it.

To further learn Hugo and learn more, read through the Hugo [documentation](http://gohugo.io/overview/introduction)
or browse around the files in this repository.
