Sabayon blog (Hugo-powered)
=================

State: draft

Getting Started
---------------

To get started, you should simply fork or clone this repository! That's definitely an important first step.

[Install Hugo](http://gohugo.io/overview/installing) in a way that best suits your environment and comfort level (on sabayon you can install it by doing `sudo equo i hugo`)

In a command prompt or terminal, navigate to the path that contains your `config.toml` file and run `hugo`. That's it!
You should now have a `public` directory with a complete blog! Open `public/index.html` in your browser and bask.

If that wasn't amazing enough, from the same terminal, run `hugo server -w`. This will watch your directories for changes
and rebuild the site immediately, *and* it will make these changes available at http://localhost:1313/ so you can view
your finished site in your browser. Go on, try it. This is one of the best ways to preview your site while working on it.

To further learn Hugo and learn more, read through the Hugo [documentation](http://gohugo.io/overview/introduction)
or browse around the files in this repository. 

[This site is still a draft, join the issue to discuss a graphic and UX change.](https://github.com/Sabayon/sabayon-website-next/issues/2)


What's the current state:
---------------

* respected the links schema of the old site to avoid missing pages
* hugo skeleton for the contents and page visualization
* bootstrap and a minimal theming (design and graphic isn't actually my field of expertize)

Future (Notes also taken from users feedback):
---------------

* UI/X Redesign
* A more cool and appropriate color palette
* Jumbotron background image is just horrible && feels so default
* [...]
